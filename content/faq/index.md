> What is the difference between a Zettelkasten and a Wiki?

A Zettelkasten is your private Digital Garden. It is the work-in-progress product of you applying the Zettelkasten Method to the knowledge and information you have to deal with in your life.

A wiki is a type of software that you can use to organise knowledge and information to present it publicly or to yourself privately.

So, what is the difference? The Zettelkasten Method is the method you apply, a wiki is a type of software that you *could* use (though it's not recommended) to implement the method.
