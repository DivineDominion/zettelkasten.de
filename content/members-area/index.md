title: Roadmap for the Members Area

Dear Zettler,

I present the current roadmap for the member's area. 

My current plan is to offer you **a life-time access to all the Zettelkasten material I will develop and publish until the day I die** with a one time purchase. So, with one purchase you will have it all for life. 

In addition, there will be time-limited accountability groups. For example: The Zettelkasten Book Club. Here, we use our Zettelkastens to process the books and discuss the techniques and methods that helped us.

The content will vastly surpass the basic material on the Zettelkasten Method. As you can see from the roadmap, there will be in-depth material to equip you with tools that will elevate your thinking capacity to another level.

## The Roadmap

<%= insert_rel_image file: "2024-09-14-roadmap-zk-member.png", caption: %Q{Roadmap for the Member's Area: We are in phase 2, creating self-paced material.} %>

### Currently Working on: Zettelkasten Labs

There is a lot of cooking in the secret lab of zettelkasten.de. In Zettelkasten Labs, I will give you early access to the prototypes of thinking tools and various products. There will be a live course for the presentation.

Right now, Zettelkasten Labs is accessible for the past attendees of the ZK101 course only. This will change soon.

These are upcoming pieces:

- Knowledge Work Mastery
- The Strategy of Note-Taking. 
- How to Work a Book.

### Future Projects

- **The strategy of note-taking.** This will be an in-depth look into the decision process, when to go deep and invest into an idea and when not to.
- **Introduction into the scientific method.** This is both for the students and for non-scientists alike. If you are a member, you shouldn't have to seek out an external resource to obtain this content. However, having basic skills of the scientific method is valuable for anyone who wants to have solid foundation for his knowledge work.
- **Mastering Divergent Thinking.** Divergent thinking simply means to open up possibilities. Divergent thinking is not about having one idea, but about creating ideas. Access to divergent thinking is highly important if you need to *generate* ideas. You can only evaluate the value of an idea if you created the idea in the first place. 
- **Practical Ontology and System Theory.** This will be an extension of the knowledge building blocks with a dedicated focus to models.
- **Knowledge-Based Value Creation.** This will be an in-depth exploration on what makes knowledge valuable in the first place and how to design one's practice of knowledge work to facilitate value creation.
- **The Nootropic Lifestyle.** This will be an extensive protocol on how to various tools and methods to support your brain. Expect a comprehensive biohacking class on how to treat your brain like an athlete treats his body.
- **How To Work a Book.** An in depth course, on how to *digest* a book fully.
- **Getting Things Created.** If you know Getting Things Done, you already recognised the pattern of the title. Expect a system that is for creative people that need to organise deep work.
