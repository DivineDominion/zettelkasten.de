<!-- Benefit -->

This course will improve your thinking. We equip you with skills to create valuable knowledge from every single thought.

<!-- Auslösendes Ereignis -->

The note box actually makes a very strange promise:

> Write a note now and it will be useful to you in 5, 10 or even 20 years, perhaps even providing an ingenious solution to a problem. Even though you want to solve completely different problems and will even be a completely different person.

<!-- Komplikation -->

We are already encountering a strange phenomenon: we often don't even understand why we wrote something down a month later.

<!-- Krise -->

If we want to build a lifelong system, a box of notes, a thinking partner, we have to become a thinker ourselves who can work with such a thinking partner. This means that we work in such a way that we are immediately creative at the moment we record a thought. 

<!-- Höhepunkt -->

The solution is that we write notes in such a way that the act of writing is itself already value-creating. To do this, we will acquire thinking techniques and learn to master every single thought.

<!-- Auflösung -->

The wonderful result will be that you will no longer need to remember why you wrote a note 10 years ago. It will be timelessly valuable.
