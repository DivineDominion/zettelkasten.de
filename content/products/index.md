We are constantly working on our toolchain and Christian creates software applications to make our life easier. And we're both writing a lot, every day. Some articles and Zettel notes find their way into little companion books for you. You can get them here. Of course, we're still working on _The Big One_, the Zettelkasten method book, too.

We've put online the [table of contents](/book/) of our english book draft to let you get a first impresson of where we're heading.

Meanwhile, the German book is already published, as you can see from the cover image. Take a look at [its project page](/book/de/). (German)
