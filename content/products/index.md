We are constantly working on our toolchain and Christian creates software applications to make our life easier. And we're both writing a lot, every day. Some articles and Zettel notes find their way into little companion books for you. You can get them here. Of course, we're still working on _The Big One_, the Zettelkasten method book, too.
