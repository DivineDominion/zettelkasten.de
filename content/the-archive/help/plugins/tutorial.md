Great! Here's how to get started with the tools provided by _The Archive_ to make plug-in development easy.

## Start Development Within _The Archive_

_The Archive_ provides a plug-in development tool. Use it to interactively write, test, and export plug-ins.

From the app's main menu, go to <i>Plugin - Show Developer Console</i> to get started.

### The Plug-In Development Window

<%= insert_rel_image file: "plugin-development-screenshot.png", caption: "The built-in plug-in development tool" %>

On the left, you have these three programming components:

1. The JavaScript editor. It's an auto-saving scratchpad for your code. Upon exporting, this becomes your [`main.js` file](/the-archive/help/plugins/bundle-format/) that'll be executed.
2. The console log. It shows any output your plug-in generates. It also lists settings changes an other status messages.
3. The console <abbr title="Read-Eval-Print Loop">REPL</abbr>. You can enter any JavaScript expression there, an it will evaluate once you commit with Enter/Return (<kbd>‚èé</kbd>). You can also access previous expressions with <kbd>‚åò‚Üë</kbd> and <kbd>‚åò‚Üì</kbd>. Use the "Reset" toolbar button if you want to e.g. clear all variable and function declarations that linger from previous executions.

On the right, you have **the Plug-In Settings Inspector** that configure [your plug-in Manifest file's](/the-archive/help/plugins/bundle-format/) access privileges to resources like all notes in the app, or the currently edited note's content. While it can be a bit tedious to configure these things, it's an important safety measure to protect plug-in users -- especially those who are less tech-savvy! Without a proper declaration, it's impossible for plug-ins to get a hold of your notes. Users can be sure when their data is safe.

The "Copy Settings as JavaScript" button in the sidebar generates boilerplate to work with the global JavaScript objects that correspond to your settings.

On the top of the window, the toolbar offers:

- a "Run" button that immediately executes your work-in-progress plug-in code with the environmental settings from the inspector,
- an "Export" button to save your plug-in for you with the current settings from the inspector.
- The "Reset" button resets the interactive REPL. When you build up expressions or script ideas in the REPL, you may want to start fresh and clear all variable or function declarations.

### Discovering Components With the REPL

Learning to ask the program for what a value is can be helpful in developing your plug-ins. Then you don't need to run the whole plug-in everytime. You can build up the REPL's context one by one interactively, e.g. by adding one function after another, then running the functions interactively and refine them. The REPL's context persists until you use the _Reset_ button at the top of the window. Use this to get a clean slate in the REPL, e.g. when you declared a `const`, like `const x = 2;`, but then decide you need it to be some other value, that won't work -- because you cannot change constants by definition. You need to reset the context for that to work.

The settings from the inspector sidebar immediately affect which variables are available in your plug-in's code.

By default, all access privileges are turned off, and you need to enable what you need. Once you enabled access to _Selected Notes_, for example, The Archive will make the `input.notes.selected` object available to your code.

To discover what you can actually access from code, use the interactive REPL text field and start by typing "`input`".  That will show your input string and the evaluated output value in the console right above:

```
> input
‚á† [object Object]
```

Since the JavaScript engine's built-in reflection isn't very helpful to discover what an object is made of, The Archive offers a helper function to provide more details: a function called `dump`. Let's try that:

```
> dump(input)
‚á† {
  "notes": {
    "selected": {
      "0": {
        "path": "/path/to/notes/Learning JavaScript.txt",
        "filename": "Learning JavaScript",
        "content": "#professional #js is easy! See [[how to learn anything]]",
        "tags": {
          "0": "professional",
          "1": "js"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

That shows the object hierarchy in a much nicer way: you can see that `input` has a property called `notes` which is an object with a property called `selected` -- which is an array with one element at index `0`. To access this in JavaScript, you'd write `input.notes.selected[0]`. This, in turn, is an object that represents the currently visited note in the editor, including the full path, the filename, and full text content.

You can even run `dump(this)`, where `this` outside of any function or object refers the so-called **global context**, to list and describe everything that is available as free functions and global variables in your JavaScript code.

> Tip: During interactive development in the REPL, don't use `const` unless you're very certain you got things right. Prefer `let` or even `var` to make global variables replaceable. Use `function myFunc() { ... }` instead of `const myFunc = () { ... }`, because `function`s are replaceable as well. In your final plug-in, you may want to change things to more idiomatic JavaScript and use `const` more often.


## Exporting and Sharing Plug-Ins

From the development tool, you can export your plug-in as a `.thearchivebundle` with an interactive wizard. See [the bundle format overview](/the-archive/help/plugins/bundle-format/) for what goes inside.

- **Title**: User-facing title of your plug-in. Will be shown in plug-in listings in the app and online.
- **Identifier**: The unique plug-in ID. This will be the same as the bundle file name. Prefer to use reverse domain format to group plug-ins by creator and avoid name conflicts for generic plug-in names. Ours will start with `de.zettelkasten.`.
- **Description:** User-facing descriptive text. Will be shown in plug-in listings in the app and online. You can use Markdown.
- **Release date:** Current day in ISO format (`YYYY-MM-DD`). This will be pre-filled to your computer's current date.
- **Plug-in version**: This is the version of your creation. Please use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) where possible, e.g. to signal "something is very different" when you go from `1.x.x` to `2.x.x`. (This will be even more important when other plug-ins can import your code in the future.)<!-- TODO: Remove remark when plug-in dependencies are implemented-->
- **App version**: This is the version of _The Archive_ you want to target. To ensure that your plug-in can run on the user's computer, this version needs to be set to the version that introduces a feature you want to use. Currently, the only target version that works is `1.8.0`, but we plan to introduce new features in the future that won't be available to `1.8.0`-targeting plug-ins.
- **Can read** and **Effects when run** list the privileges requested by the plug-in, as configured in the Manifest inspector, and like the user will see them in plug-in listings.

The export wizard remembers some of your settings, like your name, to ease exporting future plug-ins.

## Examples Use Cases

### How to Read the Current Note's ID

Request _Selected notes_ access in the inspector. This will contain 1 note object when the user edits a note, or 0 if the user has selected no note, or more than 1 if the user selects many. While users can _select_ multiple notes, it's not possible to _edit_ multiple notes in one window. So if there's just 1 note, that means the user is also looking at it in the editor.

The plug-in code boilerplate generated by _Copy Settings as JavaScript_ will then produce:

```js
// Each note object has these properties:
// - `path`: The absolute POSIX path to that file.
// - `filename`: The filename without extension.
//    (Can be considered the title.)
// - `content`: The full text of the note.

// Array of selected notes. Can be empty, the currently visited (edited) note,
// or multiple notes for bulk operations.
const selectedNotes = input.notes.selected;

// üìù Your Script Goes Here!
```

To get the filename of the currently edited note, and abort if none or too many are selected, write your script like so:

```js
if (selectedNotes.length !== 1) {
  cancel(`Editing 1 note required, but user selected ${selectedNotes.length} notes.`);
}

const currentNote = selectedNotes[0];
const currentNoteID = app.extractNoteID(currentNote.filename);
```


## Your Plug-in's Lifecycle

Your plug-in runs in a clean sandbox environment every time. It is unaffected by previous plug-in executions, no matter if it's your plug-in or someone else's. In technical terms, there's no shared mutable state you need to worry about. **The only shared state is available in the user's note files.**

As a result, you can focus on writing your plug-in so that:

1. it gathers information from the app and the user,
2. performs a computation, and then
3. produces an effect that is carried out by the app.

Your plug-in behaves like a sub-routine or "function". You implement the algorithm "in the middle" to perform the computation, and rely on _The Archive_ to provide the inputs at the beginning and carry out the effects in the end.

### One Plug-In, One Effect

Plug-ins are designed to and encouraged to perform _one_ effect, which is carried out by _The Archive_ immedately when the plug-in's code finishes execution.

For example, you cannot write a plug-in that creates thousands of files for the user in a loop.

But you can tell the app to carry out 1 effect like file creation once the plug-in successfully finished computation.

The key difference to imperative programming that you may do in e.g. Python scripts is that your plug-in _describes_ the desired effect only. It does not actually execute it. _The Archive_ interprets the effect you describe and then executes it at the end for you.

This ensures that user's data is safe (you cannot delete or overwrite all of their precious notes) and secure (you cannot upload it anywhere from within plug-ins).

This approach currently reduces the potential power of automation within _The Archive_. We encourage plug-in authors to re-think what you want to achieve in terms of purely functional value transformations. Reduce the scope of what your plugin does to 1 thing, and in turn help your users understand what they sign up for when they install your plug-in. 

> Future plug-in system updates will include composition of plug-ins to express more complex behavior, and remote-controlling the app on the user's behalf. Eventually, the plug-in system will also incorporate inherently dangerous capabilities -- i.e. those that _The Archive_ cannot check or validate properly, like running external applications. We'll get to that point in iterations.

### What "Value Transformations Over Imperative Code" Means for You

From _The Archive_'s perspective as much as the user's, your plug-in is a black-box that performs some computation on inputs provided by the app, and producing a description of an effect that is handed back to the app to be executed. The part in the middle that is the computation of the change is a function that transforms the inputs into an effect. Depending on your experience, this may require some re-thinking.

Say you want to write a plug-in that transforms each line of the selected text into an enumerated list, but using alphabetical notation like `a)`, `b)`, `c)`, etc.

If you were taugt the imperative mindset in the past, and think of this task in terms of automating what the user does, you would want to move the cursor to the beginning of the first line and insert `"a) "`, then move to the beginning of the next line and insert `"b)"`, and so on until you reach the end of the selection, similar to how the user would move the cursor with the arrow keys and type to insert text. Imitating what the user would do is a reasonable mental model of an automation. Because you moved the cursor, the selected range of text is gone, though, and you wouldn't know when to stop prepending enumerated list markers. So you have store the selection's end location before you begin moving the cursor around. Say the selected range was from character location `100` to `1000` in the text. Because your automation inserted two enumerations plus a space each by this point, `"a) "` and `"b) "`, you have changed the text's total length by 6 characters. This affects when you need to stop, so you need to add `+3` to the end location `1000`, getting `1000+3+3=1006`. In other wirds, the more text you insert, the more the location of the character that used to be at the end of the user's selection in the text moves away, and you need to keep track of this. Now if you abort the process in the middle for any reason (could be a bug in the computation of the next enumeration character in the alphabet after "z" that produces an error, for example), the users ends up with a half-finished change to their note, but overall it's in an unexpected state. In some cases when your automation fails mid-process, this could mean that the user _loses data_, which is very unpleasant.

Pseudo code for the imperative approach:

```
// Pseudo Code
set enumerationCharacter to "a"
set endLocation to the selectedRange's current endLocation
moveToBeginningOfLine
while cursor location < endLocation {
  // Insert enumeration
  insert enumerationCharacter
  insert ") "

  // Adjust the stop condition
  set endLocation to endLocation
    + length of enumerationCharacter
    + length of ") "
  set enumerationCharacter to next character in alphabet

  // Move to beginning of next line
  moveCursorToEndOfLine
  moveCursorRight
}
```

If instead you think about your whole plug-in as a single value transformation, you can grab the selected text from the app, then split it by line breaks, prepend a suitable enumeration character to each line, merge all lines back together, and finally tell the app to replace the selection with that computed result. You don't need to move the cursor at all, and conversely can't make a mistake on that front. Any fatal error during the plug-in's execution aborts the computation and no effect will be carried out.

Plug-in code to perform this transformation:

```js
// Produces 0=>"a", 1=>"b", ..., 25=>"z", 26=>"aa", etc.
const enumerationCharacter = (i) => {
  let letters = '';
  while (i >= 0) {
    letters = String.fromCharCode((i % 26) + 97) + letters;
    i = Math.floor(i / 26) - 1;
  }
  return letters;
};

// Transform the selected lines into a list ...
const result = input.text.selected
  .split("\n")
  .map((line, i) => `${enumerationCharacter(i)}) ${line}`)
  .join("\n");
  
// ... then replace the selected text with the transformation.
output.insert.setText(result);
```
