  <h2>Our Software Ethics</h2>

  <p><strong>Update Policy:</strong> We have a vision of the first version of <em>The Archive</em>. We are very up front about the features that will be included in version&nbsp;1 of <em>The Archive</em>. You can expect we implement all the features we announce for v1 and ship them as free updates. And we are bug hunters. We will do our best to kill all of them.</p>

  <p><strong>Version Policy:</strong> We don&#8217;t like the thought of selling a paid version&nbsp;2 upgrade just because we need cash. We believe in being open and clear about our promises from the beginning. After the v1 is completed we will continue to ship stability updates and continue begin work on <em>The Archive</em> v2. </p>

  <p><strong>We value loyalty!</strong> If you are a proud owner of this first release, you are part of the club. v2 will come with a hefty discount for you. You will pay less for v1 + v2 combined than those who join in v2.</p>
