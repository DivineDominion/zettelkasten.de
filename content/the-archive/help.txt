## Frequently Asked Questions

How do I create notes?
:   There are different ways to create a note, each with pros and cons depending on your workflow.
    
    1. Type the note title you want into the Omnibar and hit Return. If you type a term in the Omnibar that is not used as the name of a note already, *The Archive* will create a matching note for you; if a note exists, it will be opened instead. 
    2. Use a Wiki-Link: create a link that leads nowhere, click on it to follow the link. There'll be no note to show, but the Omnibar contains the link now. Then create a note from the Omnibar as you would above. The Wiki-link feature is built on top of the search. Similar rules apply to entering a term in the Omnibar: if a note with the linked text exists, it will be displayed for you. If there is no matching note, you can hit Return from the Omnibar to create a note with the title set to the search term.
    3. Create an empty note in *The Archive* without changing your search. Just hit <kbd>⌘N</kbd> (or pick **Note ‣ New** from the menu). The Archive will create a note for you that will be named "Untitled" and take you right into the editor. After you complete the note you can rename it by hitting <kbd>⌘R</kbd> (or via **Note ‣ Rename** from the main menu).
    4. Use the "Quick Entry" popup window from anywhere on your system to capture a thought. You have to configure the shortcut in the application preferences (<kbd>⌘,</kbd>) to make it globally accessible.


How do I create links between notes?
: To create links between notes, you need to define how to *target* a note first. On the web, it is simple: each website has its own unique address that you can copy from the address bar of your web browser.

  When you work with plain text files, it might sound obvious to use the file names. And if you want to have clickable links, you might use the full path to a note, like `file:///Users/JaneDoe/Archive/some-note.txt`. But that's fragile, since the links break when you rename the note or move your archive to a different path.

  This is how we do it: every Zettel note gets its own unique ID. We choose the timestamp-like IDs like `201402260939` which would be based on the date "2014-02-26 9:39a.m." Moments in time are unique; and the ID should be fixed, so the note title is not a good candidate as it may change over time.

  When you reference a note from someplace else, you paste the ID there. You will soon learn to recognize such sequences of digits as IDs because of the way they look. Then you know, "there's a Zettel with this ID, I should check it out!"

  *The Archive* tries to be helpful and aid you with these nifty `[[Double Bracket Wiki-Links]]`, which trigger a search. Adhering to the double-square-bracket convention of wikis, you get clickable links using Zettel IDs without buying into any proprietary file format or fragile file paths.

How do I link to notes from other apps?
: As with internal connection, using a file-based link isn't a very durable way to point into your note archive from outside. We suggest you simply paste the ID for maximum durability. 
: If you really want to create a link to click on that launches _The Archive_ and opens an appropriate note, we got you covered with a **external link URL scheme**:
    

  - `thearchive://search/TERM` searches for `TERM` as if you typed it in
  - `thearchive://match/TERM` works like the search but displays a good match directly; this is similar to `[[Wiki-Links]]`.
  - `thearchive://matchOrCreate/TERM` will create a note of the exact title `TERM` if that doesn't exist; it's similar to entering a search term into the Omnibar and hitting the return key.


## Sending in Log Files for Errors

You can send log files from within the app by choosing **Help ‣ Send Log Files…**. This will attach log files of up to 5 days of app activity. You can remove irrelevant log files from the email draft. 

Please make sure to delete confidential information from the log if necessary using any text editor.

## Sending in Crash Reports

macOS 10.12 and later:

- Open the built-in **Console.app**: Open Finder, choose *Go ‣ Utilities*, open the Console application.
- Click on **User Reports** under _Reports_ at the left side of the window. (If there's no sidebar to your left, choose *View ‣ Show Sources*.)
- In the middle, a list of files will appear, showing a collection of all crash reports. Choose the file or files starting with "The Archive", like "The&nbsp;Archive_2018-03-14.crash".
- Click the **Share** button in the toolbar and select Mail. (If you do not use Apple Mail as your email client, you can instead Copy and Paste the whole crash report into your email client.)

macOS 10.11 and earlier:

- Open the built-in **Console.app**: Open Finder, choose *Go ‣ Utilities*, open the Console application.
- Expand **User Diagnostics Reports** under _Diagnostics and Usage Information_ from the left sidebar of the window.
- A list of crash reports will appear. Choose the file or files starting with "The Archive", like "The&nbsp;Archive_2018-03-14.crash".
- Right-click and choose **Reveal in Finder**. Then attach the selected files to an email and send it to us.
