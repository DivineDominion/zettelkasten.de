## During the Beta 

This is planned so far, but we'll adjust the roadmap when you report something that we've missed:
 
- Zettel ID awareness (making editing and working with them more useful)
- Note header support
- Basic Markdown highlighting
- Faster note navigation, like a history
- Autocompletion of bracket pairs and Markdown emphasis
- Useful "First Launch" experience with demo data

### Known issues

Please be aware of the following quirks and problems:

- Performance is <del>awful</del> <ins>bearable</ins> in large archives.
- Renaming notes to the same title of a similar note will report an error and not show the old name.
- Deleting a note with Cmd+Backspace while you're inside the Omnibar will not be undoable when you type something.
- Replacing search terms from the system standard search bar (âŒ˜F) is not undoable.
- The iSight/camera snapping does not work when you have "Camera Guard Pro" installed.

## Planned Features of "Version 1"

This list is probably going to change.

We decided to be radically transparent what you can expect. You don't only invest in current utility of the app. You invest in future improvements, too. Transparency is part of our business ethics.

This initial version is all about getting productive and having a great user experience.

So far, the following big features are planned to be added to version 1:

- Note quick entry from anywhere (done)
- Saved searches, aka "Filters" (done)
- Typewriter mode
- Internationalization
- Customizable Markdown editor templates
- Show backlinks of notes
- Tag index
- Manage images
- Scriptability

That's what you'll get with a license for version 1. There will be an upgraded version 2 coming afterwards, where we've planned to expand the app beyond the current scope of power and functionality. If you already own a license for version 1, you'll get an chunky discount for your past support. 

## Vision of Version 2

For version 2, we envision an application that does way more than make note-taking and working with notes simpler. The whole Zettelkasten Method is about organization _as a means to produce more._ Being able to quickly write and connect notes is nice, but what about writing?

- Outliner interface to [assemble](/posts/tags/assemble/) writing projects from your notes
- Connection visualizer
- Table support
- Reference management hooks and citation awareness
- Mathematical formula editor
