# The Archive: Version Roadmap

<a href="/the-archive/" class="back--link"><img src="/the-archive/img/appicon-sm.png" class="back--image" /><span class="back--text">Back to the Project Page</span></a>

We decided to be radically transparent what you can expect. You don't only invest in current utility of the app. You invest in future improvements, too. Transparency is part of our business ethics.

## Version 1: The Core

This initial version is all about getting productive and having a great user experience.

The following big features are planned to be added to version 1:

<ul class="todos">
  <li class="todo done">Note quick entry from anywhere</li>
  <li class="todo done">Saved searches, aka "Filters"</li>
  <li class="todo done">Typewriter mode</li>
  <li class="todo done">Customizable Markdown editor templates</li>
  <li class="todo done">Boolean search expressions</li>
  <li class="todo">Full MultiMarkdown Support</li>
  <li class="todo">Browser-Type Navigation</li>
  <li class="todo">Dark Mode</li>
  <li class="todo">Tag Index</li>
  <li class="todo">Inline Image Preview</li>
  <li class="todo">Mass Text Replacement</li>
  <li class="todo">Scriptability</li>
</ul>

That's what you'll get with a license for version 1. There will be an upgraded version 2 coming afterwards, where we've planned to expand the app beyond the current scope of power and functionality. If you already own a license for version 1, you'll get a discount for your past support.
