## v0.1.7 (2017-05-19)

* **Fixed:** Deletion bug where the wrong note was attempted to be removed.
* **Fixed:** Renaming bug that performed the change on disk but displayed an error nevertheless.
* **Fixed:** Hitting enter in the Omnibar did not always began editing the note.
* **Changed:** Hashtags in brackets or quotes are now clickable.
* **New:** "Capture Image" in the edit menu lets you create snapshots to quickly include drawings into your notes.
* **New:** Configure the path where snapshots are stored relative to your archive. Defaults to `./media/`.

This release introduces yet another open source library I created, now 3 in total.

## v0.1.6 (2017-05-16)

* **Fixed:** Clicking a hashtag does not deselect the currently visible note.
* **Fixed:** Don't select a random note after start.
* **Fixed:** Keep note selected in the results list when the search results change.

## v0.1.5 (2017-05-15)

* **Fixed:** Archive is faster when reacting to links. -- Is performance a "fix"? Well, higher reliability is! Medium-sized archives (Sascha's and mine with 4800 and 3800 notes resp.) didn't always follow clicked `[[Wiki Link]]`s. If you had looked at the event log, you'd see that a lot of stuff would go on, sometimes leading to showing the note with the link again instead of the link target. But no more!
* **Fixed:** The Omnibar. Like, in total. There were so many different edge cases over the last couple days that I cannot recall what was wrong initially. Especially in large archives with the current _SuperSlowSearch_™ it became unusable. Look out for this:
    * When you click a `[[WikiLink]]`, the Omnibar should display the link text. If the target note is not among the filtered search results, reset the search to display it in the results list. Keep the search as it was otherwise.
    * When you click a `#hashtag`, the Omnibar should display the tag as search term, ultimately resetting the search. (But not the active filter!)
    * When you type, the Omnibar should show the characters you've typed, no matter how slow the search. Your will is its command.
    * When you type and a note among the search results begins with your search term, the Omnibar should auto-complete your input and display the note in anticipatory obedience.
    * When you delete parts of the search, auto-completion should not be active. Only when you type. Also, the display should reset to "nothing".
* **Changed:** Perceived performance when searching is better. When you type faster than the _SuperSlowSearch_™ can sift through your notes, you won't be interrupted, the app won't freeze, and it won't show outdated auto-completion suggestions. On the flip side, if you want to see intermediate search results in huge archives, you have to wait at the end. This is an interesting psychological effect: Since the typing up until the end is now undelayed, the single and final delay feels like an eternity. Before, you got used to the slow response time. It was annoying, too, but different.
* **Changed:** Printing is disabled for now because the system's default is pretty useless. Will come back with a revenge later during the beta.
* **Changed:** Changing a note but then undoing the change no longer touches and overwrites the file to reduce disk load. (And to keep the event log smaller. 😁)

## v0.1.4 (2017-05-12)

* **Fixed:** Hiding the sidebar does not shrink but grow the note text editor as expected.
* **Fixed:** Filename conflicts when renaming notes are now resolved by appending `.1`, `.2`, `.3`, ... (whichever is free) to the desired title.
* **Fixed:** Clicking on `#hashtag` links now searches for notes with that phrase instead of creating a note called `#hashtag`. `[[Wiki Links]]` still work as expected: they search for a note starting with the link content or create a new note if none exists.
* **Changed:** Sorting options in View > Sort By are now less clever and say what you'll get on the tin.


## v0.1.3 (2017-05-12)

* **Fixed:** Window and results list sizes are restored when re-opening the app.
* **Fixed:** `[[Wiki links]]` are now clickable when you add parens around them. Or punctuation marks.
* **Fixed:** The directory selection panel now shows the "New Folder" button y'all have been missing so badly.
* **Fixed:** Searching in the Omnibar now does not replace the case you typed in when auto-completing suggestions. So if you have a note called "Banana" and you type "ban", the Omnibar will show "banana". Also, this way you can start note titles with different cases than existing notes starting with the same letter :) (Thanks to Rocco Nicosia for finding that one!)
* **Changed:** The results list shows numbers in monospaced variant so your note IDs are all of the same width.
* **Changed:** Before deleting a note, you'll now get a confirmation dialog.
* **Changed:** The archive selection window is now less ugly.
* **Changed:** The divider of note editor and search results is now thicker for better partitioning of the space available.
* **New:** The help menu has new items to send feedback and get to this website.

## v0.1.2 (2017-05-10)

* **Fixed:** Double-hash hashtags (`##example`) are now clickable. Sascha uses them for broader categories in his archive.
* **Fixed:** Creating an empty note now selects and edits the new note automatically.
* **Fixed:** Clicking a link triggers a search (and puts the cursor into the Omnibar). If there is a partial matching note (a note that starts with the link anchor text), that note will be selected and editing starts. This way you can use wiki links to IDs like `[[201705101030]]` and jump to the note right away.
* **Fixed:** Creating a new note aborted editing after a couple of seconds because the Finder/file system updates the file in the background again. These background refreshers should not affect your active editing session anymore.
* **Fixed:** Changing a note, then focusing the Omnibar deselected the note and displayed "Nothing Selected" instead of the note's text.
* **Fixed:** Quick entry helper updates with colors and font changes.
* **New:** You can change the font size of the search results list on the left. BIGGER TEXT FOR EVERYBODY!

## v0.1.1 (2017-05-09)

* **Fixed:** entering an existing note title in the Omnibar, then hitting enter, previously resulted in an attempt to create the same note twice.
* **Fixed:** The Omnibar now shows the title of the selected note as you change the selection.
* **Fixed:** The note editor now scrolls. For real.
* **New:** Typing in the Omnibar selects a note from the results that starts with the exact title. Since IDs are at the beginning, this is pretty much useless for regular Zettel notes unless I make the archive "Zettel-aware", that is treat notes with IDs differently.
* **New:** Hitting Enter in an empty Omnibar creates an empty note and displays it.
* **New:** "X"-button to clear the selection added to the Omnibar.
* **New:** ⌘C (copy) from the search results list is now possible.
* **New:** The search results's background color now changes with the editor color.
* **New:** You can specify the minimum inner distance between the editor text field's border and the text, also known as inset or padding.
* **Changed:** Searching inside a note using ⌘F does not display a separate window anymore but the more modern "search bar" at the top.

**Known issue:** replacing content from the search bar is not undoable.

## v0.1.0 (2017-04-28)

I won't list everything I did to get this first useful version up and running (and kinda polished, compared to my first TableFlip build) because "a running app with functionality" is pretty self-explanatory already. We have text file editing, a quick entry helper, editor style preferences, and filter management, basically.

Instead, here are some fun facts:

* Thanks to all the open source libraries I use (including self-made ones), the overhead affecting the file size is huge: this version takes up 38&nbsp;MB of disk space. 😱 Is this really the future? Then again, any Electron-based app (like Slack, VisualStudio Code, Atom, and numerous others) will need at least 110&nbsp;MB because there's a full Chrome browser included.
* I started my first experiment in code on 19th November, 2016. (And I didn't do anything for most of March thanks to my post-op.)
* It took 697 source code repository commits (= micro milestones I checked in) to get this far.
* With 921 unit test cases, this is the project with the most automated test I ever wrote on my own. (Projects where I did work in a team had significantly less tests, by the way.)
* I extracted and published 2 new open source libraries in the process and updated another one that I published back when I released TableFlip for beta.
