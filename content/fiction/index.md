The Zettelkasten Method will support your goals relating to both consuming and producing fiction texts. The Zettelkasten Method is designed to **create a thinking machine out of your notes that supports *all of your thinking*.**

<!--N FÃ¼r alles zu gebrauchen -->
The Zettelkasten Method is commonly associated with non-fiction texts. However, the Zettelkasten Method is not tied to any goal within the realm of knowledge.

## Zettelkasten Method for Fiction by Sascha Fast

<!--N How to read -->
This four-part series is designed to get you started. You can learn about specific techniques on analysing and writing fiction. Read this series as an inspiration what you *can* do, not what you *should* do.

The **first part** of the series is somewhat controversial since I commit a literary sin: I divorce the quote from the source and process not with any obligation to the text. @dgbecher highlighted this issues with this approach with a very justified critique. So, you might read the text within the context of [this](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/comment/14011/#Comment_14011) and [this](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/comment/14635/#Comment_14635) comment:

[Knowledge is Knowledge](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-fiction-writing-part-1-knowledge/). You don't need to care about the source if you don't want to.

The **second part** of the series aims to provide you with a framework on how stories work. I provide you with a framework of building blocks of stories similar to my [species of knowledge for non-fiction](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/reading-is-searching/). I base this frame work on "story practicians" like Coyne[^coyne] or Truby.[^truby2008]

I attended to a couple of classes in literary studies at University. When I started to learn about stories I was struck by the difference of people who teach to write stories and and my experience in literary studies. Later, when I read authors like Jordan Peterson, Jonathan Pageau and Christopher Booker on how they analyse stories, I came to the conclusion that their approach to stories is much closer to the "story practicians" (Truby, Coyne and the like) than the "story theoreticians" (mostly academics).

[What you can look for in a story](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-fiction-writing-part-2-elements-of-story/). Understand story before you attempt to analyse it.

The **third** part of the series serves as a bridge between analysing stories and creating stories. Tools can be used to both assemble and disassemble stories.

[Create a toolbox to analyse stories that lives in your Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-fiction-writing-part-3-tools-analysing-story/). Working with those tools is both an opportunity to understand or create stories and sharpen the tools along with your skill to use it.

The **fourth** part of the series is geared towards producing stories. There are many ways to skin this cat. I present some ways that you can use within the framework of the Zettelkasten Method. If you have a Zettelkasten, why not harness its power to support this endeavour of yours? The setup is so similar to writing non-fiction texts that this part of the series is titled:

[Writing books is writing books](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-fiction-writing-part-4-create-story/). The Zettelkasten Method stays the same whether you apply it to writing fiction or non-fiction. The reason is that the Zettelkasten Method entails very general principles. The word "general" essentially means "non-changing". This unchanging nature is the difference between "general" and "specific".

## Q&A

If you have an *interesting* question on how to use the Zettelkasten Method for Fiction you can [drop it in the forum](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/2064/). If the question is interesting enough and it fits into my time schedule I'll write a blog post and add it to this section.

## The Zettelkasten Method for Literary Studies

The Zettelkasten Method provides a framework for *your personal thinking*. It aims to generate a thinking machine out of your notes that supports *all of your thinking*. Most of the material on this page is geared towards a "story practicians". See the discussion between @sfast (me) and @dgbeecher starting from [this post](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/comment/14011/#Comment_14011) to understand the difference. I am fully aware that the approach I present is not in line with, even heretical to, the conventional approaches in the field of literary studies.

However, when I finished outlining the general scope of the Zettelkasten Method there I will dedicate some time to specific applications like *The Zettelkasten Method for Historians* or *The Zettelkasten Method for Theologians*. *The Zettelkasten Method for Literary Studies* is sprouting in my Zettelkasten already. In the mid- to long-term, I will be able to ship this specific application of the Method.

## _The Archive_ for Fiction Writing

A good environment for thinking and writing is *distraction-free*. As a simple rule of thumb: The more it disappears from you perception the better it is. This is the reason why distraction free editors became so popular. [*The Archive*][thearchive] is and will be designed in the spirit of being distraction-free. Our user feedback is quite consistent in this point: *The Archive* delivers a very calm and clean experience with minimal distractions.

While the Zettelkasten Method is software-agnostic, it can be implemented with any software and even without software and just index cards, applying it to Fiction Writing benefits a lot from a low distraction writing environment. App features shouldn't feel intrusive to your thinking and writing.

So, consider [*The Archive*][thearchive] (macOS) as your distraction-free Zettelkasten and Note-Taking App to benefit from a low-distraction writing environment.
