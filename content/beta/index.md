Christian has been working on a Mac app that we've dubbed _The Archive_. It's a Zettel note archive app to help you implement the Zettelkasten Method and produce more stuff.
  
Now we're looking for feedback and beta testers in May.

## FAQ

### I'm a subscriber of the regular Newsletter already. Do I still have to subscribe?

Yes! We won't spam our readers with project news. If you want to be part of the development progress, sign up below, no matter what you did in the past.

### Will you be spamming me like all the other douchebags do on their mailing lists?

Nope. We will only keep this list alive during the development of the app. That's why we keep separate lists, too: because we don't want to lure you into anything.
