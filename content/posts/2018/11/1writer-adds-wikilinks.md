When people ask me, "Christian, what's the best Zettelkasten Method-compatible app on iPads and iPhones?", I always tell them about 1Writer. Its search is good. It syncs files with a ton of services. It handles `#hashtags`. 

And now it also supports `[[Wiki Links]]`.

That makes it an even better companion to our very own macOS app, _The Archive_, and the plain text productivity techniques we encourage people to use.
