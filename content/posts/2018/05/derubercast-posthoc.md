We were invited to join [Patrick Welker of rocketink.net](https://rocketink.net) and [Andreas Zeitler aka Zettt](http://zettt.com/) of the German Podcast _Der Ubercast_ to introduce our Zettelkasten Method to their audience and talk a bit about _The Archive_. Sascha explains a lot of the thinking behind IDs, structure, and why plain text is just the best. Thanks for having us, folks!
