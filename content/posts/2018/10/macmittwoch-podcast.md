In the nearby town of Paderborn, there's a community-organized meetup called "[MacMittwoch][]" (literal translation: "MacWednesday" -- guess when they meet :)). These fine folks produce a podcast, too, and their Farid Mésbahi and Gordon Möller visited Sascha and me in Bielefeld for a very nice chat. The result is [Episode 15: Der Zettelkasten][ep].

We talked about _[The Archive](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/)_, but even more did we talk about the Zettelkasten Method in general, about emerging structure versus folder management, and why we value software agnosticism above all. Farid and Gordon are very welcoming and curious hosts, and Sascha and I are pleasant to the ear as always, of course, so you will want to listen to [this episode][ep] (1h 8min; German only).
