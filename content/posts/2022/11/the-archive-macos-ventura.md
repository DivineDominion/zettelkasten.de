[The Archive][ta] is ready for Apple's latest version of macOS, available since the start of this week.

<%= insert_teaser_image %>

We recommend you wait with upgrading to macOS 13 Ventura until 13.1 comes out, if you haven't already, because the initial `.0` releases often ship with annoyances or bugs that get sorted out in minor updates a couple of weeks later.

And to everyone on Ventura, enjoy The Archive as usual!

P.S.: An update to The Archive that improves image import, especially via clipboard, will arrive in a short while.
