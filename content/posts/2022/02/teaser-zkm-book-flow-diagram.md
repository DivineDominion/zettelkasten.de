Hi Zettlers,

This is a little flow diagram that illustrates the Zettelkasten Process with the help of one of the principles of the Zettelkasten Method, "Creating Pre-Products":

*The concept "excerpt" might be interpreted as "literature note" since both concepts are similar.* To me, creating an excerpt is a methodological approach of using tools to understand a text. So it is more than just about creating notes on thoughts and ideas embedded in a source. (Check out this [explanation of Ahrens's terms, including "literature note"](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/concepts-sohnke-ahrens-explained/), if you want to learn more.)

*Flow diagrams can distract from the actual sites of value creation. They are mostly for superficial overview.* There are a couple of different ways to translate the Zettelkasten Method into a flow diagram. At this moment, two flow diagrams including this one are part of the book. I don't stress the concept of work*flow* since I fear that it is rather distracting from the more valuable aspects of the Zettelkasten Method. For example: It is by far more important to be able to write a good note than to have some process put in place to extract digital reading highlights from Kindle to the app of your choice.
