@lucaschultz on the forums shared an alternative icon for _The Archive_ for free for everyone to use. This came out of nowhere and was a pleasant surprise: It's really cool that Luca poured in the time and work to create "fan art" for our app!

Luca even [published the `.sketch` source files][src], so you can generate and tweak the icon further! The icon set is published under a [CC-BY-4.0 license](https://github.com/lucaschultz/the-archive-icon/blob/main/LICENSE), so you can do what you want with it, provided you mention the original author.

- **[Download the alternate icon set](https://github.com/lucaschultz/the-archive-icon/raw/main/The%20Archive.icns)**
- macOS Catalina or older: [Change the app icon](https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/01/change-mac-icons/) easily by dragging the `.icns` file onto the app icon in Finder's "Info" window.
- macOS Big Sur discourages changing icons, so the process is way more cumbersome. [Read this guide](https://appletoolbox.com/how-to-change-the-icons-for-your-favorite-apps-on-macos-big-sur/#Disable_System_Integrity_Protection) for details on how to enable the same drag & drop capability on Big Sur.
- [Browse the source][src] if you want to improve the icon.
