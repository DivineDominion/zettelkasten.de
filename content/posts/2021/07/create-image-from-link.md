Stephan Bogner ([@st_phan](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/profile/st_phan) in the forums) shared a neat and free web tool with the community the other day, a [**link preview generator**](https://link-previews.stephanbogner.de/).

It creates image previews of a website from a link. The result is optimized to be embedded into your notes without taking up too much space.

Have a look at Stephan's example of a video watch list note:

<%= insert_image file: "https://forum.zettelkasten.de/uploads/editor/gn/f44j7a3d3nk3.png", caption: "Watch list of movies: image preview focuses on video thumbnails" %>

Or this experiment application by @Will:

<%= insert_image file: "https://forum.zettelkasten.de/uploads/editor/8a/cikj4eoo4acg.png", caption: "Will tested a couple of different sites" %>

Finally, here's a close-up of Sascha's blog post, "[Don't Dehorsify the Horse](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/dont-dehorsify-the-horse/)":

<%= insert_rel_image file: "20210709205135_horsify-image.png", caption: "Blog post link preview" %>
