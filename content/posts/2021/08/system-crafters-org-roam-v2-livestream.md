On Friday, David Wilson of System Crafters hosted a 2 hour live-stream about Emacs org-roam to answer viewer questions after [his previous org-roam v2 video demo](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/org-roam-version-2/) and talk about the Zettelkasten Method in general.

Sascha and I joined the chat, too, and overall we had a good time and interesting things were discussed with the nice folk in the chat. David's recapture of the Zettelkasten basics is spot-on, and his pragmatic thinking promises good things to come from him!

If you're interested in the application of the Zettelkasten Method with org-roam v2, David focuses on this [at the 45:41 chapter mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TpWahIzueg&t=2741s).

We think you will enjoy this episode, too! David expertly moderates the chat by reading questions and comments aloud, which makes it possible to listen to the episode like a podcast, in case you don't want to stare at the screen for two hours straight.

**Sascha's Comment:** I really liked David's calm and rational perspective on the matter. I think he got many things right and even though it was a live stream (which means it is not scripted) this video is a staple for people who want to use Emacs to handle their Zettelkasten.
