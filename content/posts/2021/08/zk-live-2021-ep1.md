Dear Zettlers,

There will be a live Zettelkasten session, scheduled for Aug 13th, 2021, 19:00--21:00 CEST.

On that day, you can tune in right here:

(Link to the video: <https://youtu.be/2_MJYtWr1vE>)

It is a casual session of me working with *a* Zettelkasten. It will be especially valuable for beginner and intermediate users since I am starting a new Zettelkasten in English that I will use for demonstration purposes. I am working with it as a serious Zettelkasten and not a mock example.

Big shoutout to Andy Matuschak [who came up with the idea first](

Live long and prosper,<br>
Sascha
