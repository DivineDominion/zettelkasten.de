Recently, I took a look at my _Zettelkasten_ to see which _Zettel_ notes would make a good next post in the series.  I re-discovered plenty of material, no doubt.  Still, it occurred to me that there's a lot of important things which don't fit well in short blog posts and which neither do well when split into a series of posts.

I talked to my pal Sascha about my concerns who has plenty of experience as a writer.  He's running a thriving German blog about nutrition and healthy lifestyle called [ImprovedEating][] which I can only recommend because of the genuine research he's providing.  His blog is a platform to get feedback for the vast amount of research material for the upcoming book he's writing for about a year now.

The point is:  Sascha is a blogger, a book author and a _Zettelkasten_ user.  Without a _Zettelkasten_, he wouldn't be able to manage all the material he's researched so far.  Of course I wanted him to give me some feedback.

We considered the vast amount of notes on maintaining a _Zettelkasten_ both of us collected through the years.  In the end, we decided to create an **information product** together, that is:  a book.

Thanks to our efficient note-taking method, the book will be available soon for feedback from early adopters.  I'm pretty excited about this project and I'll definitely keep you in the loop!
