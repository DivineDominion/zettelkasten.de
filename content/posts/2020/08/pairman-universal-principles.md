I’d like to highlight this article by Joe Pairman: [Take notes as online help for your creative future self](https://blog.joepairman.com/2020/08/03/take-notes-as-online-help-for-your-creative-future-self/). 

The rare feature of this article is that Joe is extracting universal principles by comparing one of my articles with ideas of Mark Baker from [Every Page is Page One](). <!--sf: Füg deinen Affiliate Link ein --> 

I lean heavy towards the position that there are universal features of text. In fact, I have a Zettel that is named "Zettels as blogposts" in which I use the very same approach Joe used: Taking notes is creating text. What can we learn from others who create text?

Yes, some of you will learn a thing or two from this article. But my reason to share it with you is that I want to encourage you to think more broadly. There is a great quote in one of the greatest movies of all time: _Schindler's List._

> He who saves the life of one man saves the entire world.

This quote directs us to a general principle: Specifics always hint at general principles.

Shout out to Joe Pairman.
