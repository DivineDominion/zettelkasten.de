[TextMate][] is a free, open-source macOS text editor that we mention on this site since forever. It is also damn good at navigating files in a big folder. So it's a good alternative to dedicated Zettelkasten software.

In this video, I demonstrate the basic interaction patterns for TextMate to get a plain text Zettelkasten working: how to navigate around, make use of the folder-relative "Open Quickly" command, and create new notes. You know, everything you really need to be productive.

**Sascha's Comment:** Why do we publish an app that is obviously not designed to handle your Zettelkasten and therefore rather clumsy compared to more dedicated text editors? 

The reason is to abstract from software and really experience that the Zettelkasten syntax is designed to work with any text editor to give you maximum freedom. 

If you think it is slow, then compare it with a physical Zettelkasten. Even TextMate lets you handle your Zettelkasten way more quickly than a physical Zettelkasten.

**Your Zettelkasten is not the software you use.**
