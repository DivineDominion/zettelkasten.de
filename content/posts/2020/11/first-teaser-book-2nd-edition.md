This little snippet is from the section *One Sentence Summary* in the chapter *How to Write Good Notes*.

> You will read from other sources that a Zettelkasten is idiosyncratic. It can hardly be understood by another person. The reasoning is that you write in your own Zettelkasten in such a way that only you can really understand. But the thought of the future self does not allow such a weak position: **You are not yet who you will become. The future self is someone other than oneself.** Technically, we always write for someone other than ourselves. It is difficult to be understood -- even by yourself. If you write in such a way that you can be understood by as many other people as possible, there is a high probability that you will understand yourself later, too. In the span of two decades we all (hopefully) develop considerably. We are not just a little bit different. We are (hopefully) a completely different person. Arrange your Zettelkasten in such a way that anyone could operate it.
