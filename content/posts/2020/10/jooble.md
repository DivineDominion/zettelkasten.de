[Jooble](https://de.jooble.org/stellenangebote-lehrerin), the job search portal, kindly reached out and offered to feature our site on their page. [According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jooble) and their references, "Jooble is in the top 1000 most visited sites in the world" and "the second most visited job search site".

So if you're new to the Zettelkasten Method for creative knowledge work and came here from their page, welcome!

In short, the Zettelkasten Method is all about working with knowledge: you capture ideas, connect and interweave them, and thus facilitate coming up with new ideas. The process makes it easy to keep an overview of complex topics and also work on hard problems for a long time without getting lost even after week-long interruptions in your work.

<!--get started with our [introduction to the Method](https://zettelkasten.de/intro), -->

At base, the principles are to create atomic notes and links between them. To find out what this means and how that works, have a look at our [curated overview](https://zettelkasten.de/overview/), and make sure you [visit the forum](https://forum.zettelkasten.de) and get to know the amazing people there.
