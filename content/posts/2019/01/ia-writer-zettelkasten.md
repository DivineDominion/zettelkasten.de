Lorenzo wrote an article about [how to use iA Writer for macOS as your Zettelkasten note archive][post]. Apparently, [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) has a sufficiently quick search for large archives (10,000 notes big, in fact), which surprises me.

As a native macOS app, you can use iA Writer to sync with Dropbox, iCloud, and other folder-based sync services and either use their mobile or Windows counterparts, or whatever else you like. No boxing-in.

Have a look at [Lorenzo's review][post] for all the juicy details. Great work!
