[This episode](https://youtu.be/v3bbM5B9pv4) is shorter, because I didn't find many useful ideas in Chapter 3. And the ideas I did find interesting were not citable, so I had to look the originals up. That took most of the time, but did ultimately not produce many new notes.

I did add a couple, though, and in the last 5 minutes extracted a few notes from a comment I left behind that also affected the previous chapter's outline.

It's interesting that after a couple of session I already begin to form an opinion of the quality of Epstein's research. There's lots of endnotes, but the quality is ... well, enjoy this episode to find out more!
