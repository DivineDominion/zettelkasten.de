By accident, I started this episode with an outline that was surprisingly long and lended itself well to my favorite _Zettel refactoring_, called "Extract Zettel", where I take part of an existing note and put it into a new one, leaving a link in place of the cutout.

Took me 3 weeks to get into the groove, and since last time things flow quite smoothly as I hunt for precious information in this journalist's take on a complex topic.
