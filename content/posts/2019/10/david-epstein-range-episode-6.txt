This chapter's outline started out was pretty short -- and most of the stuff that I did add was anecdotes and stories. Interesting stories, sure, but nevertheless not much to brag about in front of your friends who study humanities. The actual sources will be interesting, but I didn't get to them this time.

Instead, I decided to go with placeholder notes: I added the stuff from Epstein's account and a reference to the original, but also left a note to myself both in the note (as a warning!) and in my to-do-list so I knew this is not supposed to be the end of that particular branch.

Still, the visualization from the structure note looks interesting:
