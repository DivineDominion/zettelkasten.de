Here's episode 2 for y'all! 

Everything was a _ton_ easier this time. In the previous episode, I processed the classic study by Ericsson et al on deliberate practice[^ericsson1993delprac]. That was by far the hardest nut to crack, and on top everything was recorded. That took a noticeable amount of cognitive capacity, too. And the studies I wanted to have a closer look at were either not available in full-text or irrelevant in detail, so I could focus more on the actual connection-making and writing. (The part I actually like, heh.)

Part of Sascha's feedback last time was that I should decide for myself what I want from a study: Do I want to acquire expertise in the fields of cognition, learning, or sports? Certainly not right now. So I limited what I was looking for in the papers tremendously in this episode, aiming for a very superficial understanding.

Looking at the footage, I also notice I added more commentary on top of the paraphrases. You could say there's more of my voice in the notes this time.
