Dr. Christopher Foley is a piano teacher based in Toronto, Canada. He set up The Archive to write, send, and curate lesson notes for his piano students.

**Christian's Comment:** I'm familiar with programming and the humanities, but I always wondered how a Zettelkasten could work for fine arts -- or music, for that matter. I'm looking forward to hear progress reports by Dr. Foley that go into detail!

**Sascha's Comment:** I think that shows the power of a plain text approach. Basically, all you need to do is to manipulate text. That means that you should set up a system that makes your manipulation abilities so powerful that the bottleneck in your workflow is not determined by your fingers but by your thinking. Great work, Doc. :)
