[Recently](/posts/1writer-note-archive-ipad-iphone/), I wrote about the awesome iPhone and iPad writing app [1Writer][writer]. I use it to browse my Zettelkasten when I'm not at home. 

I also mentioned a few things I missed: recent file access and either a full-text search or quickly jumping to a heading in longer documents.

Turns out recent files can be accessed via the "+" Button at the bottom. Not very obvious a place to put this, but hey.

Also, jumping to headings is possible. Not from within the app by default, but through a custom action. In the [1Writer action directory](http://1writerapp.com/actiondir), you'll find ["Jump to Section"](http://1writerapp.com/action/072ca) by [@Pgruneich](http://twitter.com/pgruneich). It shows a list of headings from which you can select, then it takes you there. That's it.

Works great and makes the app even more useful. Go 1Writer!
