We've covered [DEVONthink](/posts/tags/devonthink/) (Mac) already, and some of you may also be familiar with the very popular app for Mac and Windows, [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php). These, among other writing and knowledge management apps, are currently at a 25% discount.

Scrivener is really worth a closer look if you want to try out a new approach to writing which is very compatible with the Zettelkasten Method: working in fragments.

Check out the [sales page](http://www.devontechnologies.com/promotions/summerfest-2015.html) for a complete list.
