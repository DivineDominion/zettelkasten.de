These are very sound principles, a selection of the ones [by Micah Joel](http://micahjoel.info/2015/07/tinderbox-principles/):

* Don't throw anything away.
* Focus on making it easy to store things.
* Let emergence happen.
* Be part of the community.

The first three principles build on top of one another: keep stuff and make it easy to store it. Then you can reap the benefits: connections you did not anticipate. These principles are exactly what the Zettelkasten Method is about. 

And the last one is why we've built this site: to provide a place to talk about and discover workflows. To help each other. 

I've never used Tinderbox myself. You know we think that less is enough. But the folks using Tinderbox seem to be quite open-minded and well-organized, judging from their blogs.
