In response to [Sascha's post about _Folgezettel_][folge], Daniel published a [reaction][dan] which was intended to clarify some misunderstandings. Turns out that even after that post and [52 comments][comm], it's not quite clear where all of us seem to disagree.

Sascha is pointing out that both _Folgezettel_ and hyperlinks adhere to the principle of connectivity, and that a Folgezettel can be realized with links, and is not even something differerent on its own. That's where Daniel disagrees. But he goes even further and claims that _Folgezettel_ is more fundamental than links are.

If you have something to say, write a blog post and tell us about it so we can link to it in this discussion.
