After Sascha's great release of the Zettelkasten book, here's a short e-book from yours truly. It's a pragmatic guide to get to know the really essential tools for any writer. It's called _Minimal Writing on the Mac_.

You can buy the book on various locations:

* [iBooks Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/minimal-writing-on-the-mac/id1054667648?ls=1&mt=11)
* [Kindle Store](http://amzn.to/1kx2ofV)
* PDF, ePub, and kindle files [directly from me](https://sites.fastspring.com/christiantietze/instant/minimalmacwriting)

Also take a look at the [Productive Writer's Bundle](http://writersbundle.com) where I participate with the [Word Counter for Mac](http://wordcounterapp.com) this November.

Since I'm trying to make a living of my work, it'd be awesome if you shared this with friends and on social media to support me and my writing.
