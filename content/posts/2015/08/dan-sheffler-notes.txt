<%= insert_teaser_image title: "notebook of Dan Sheffler", caption: %{That's what Dan's notebook looks like. This is the stuff he <em>doesn't</em> need to keep around. I wonder what the really important documents look like.

Dan Sheffler, who you might know for his valuable comments on this site already, has an interesting workflow: first, he captures ideas in a study log while reading; then, he picks the gems and writes Zettel notes later.

This [difference of "engagement notes" and "memory notes"][2], as he calls it, fits the Zettelkasten method well.

"Memory notes" are Zettel notes: they are the essence of captured information.

"Engagement notes" are a replacement for what I'm doing when I [scribble paper notes on the go][read]. Paper notes are temporary. I toss them away. 

Using a notebook as a study log [like Dan does][1] works well when you are working at a desk. These notebooks may become something to keep around and show to your grandchildren. 

Just look at the beautiful image of his notebook now.

**Update 2015-08-12**: Dan uses "engagement notes" as a theoretical term; PDF annotations are engagement notes just as notes on paper or in notebooks. It just [turns out](http://zettelkasten.de/posts/getting-started/#comment-2185484422) he likes using a notebook best.
