I a recent [radio interview][not], psychology graduate student Pam Mueller told the audience that taking notes of meetings or during class on your computer is a bad idea. You forget the things faster.

Plus you can't sketch anything quickly when you're using a computer. 

Over the years at university, I adopted notes which were highly visual in style, not unlike [Sketchnotes][sn] which I heard of many years later.

As we're telling students in our coaching at my part-time job at university, it's always better for your brain to add another layer of information: space, color, image, sound, smell, story. I think that's why hand-written notes work better: you claim the space on paper in a unique manner. Even if you don't add many visuals.

Using a computer or tablet or phone to type words requires you to be in a different mindset than writing with pen in hand. That's why Sascha and I advise everyone to [take reading notes on paper first](/posts/reading-putting-it-all-together/). The gap between paper-based reading notes and the book or article you're reading is smaller, even if you read on a digital device. Typing will always be more challenging, and switching back and forth will ruin your focus.

So take notes on paper, but [write on your computer][vw], since you'll be about twice as fast to finish a first draft and produce more during the process.
