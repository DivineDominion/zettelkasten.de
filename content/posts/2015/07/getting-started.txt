With today's post on [how many Zettelkästen you should have](/posts/how-many-zettelkasten/), I have started to collect posts specifically made to get started with the method.

The [post overview](/posts/overview/) now contains a dedicated section on that.

So far we have:

* [How many Zettelkästen should I have?](/posts/how-many-zettelkasten/) The answer is, most likely, only one for the duration of your life. But there are exceptions to this rule.
* [Don't use categories.](/posts/no-categories/) Use tags instead.
* "What should my first note be?" -- [it doesn't matter.](/posts/your-first-note/) Just get started.
* [Set links between notes.](/posts/search-alone-is-not-enough) Search alone is not enough.
* You have to [interpret your sources](/posts/dont-rely-on-source-have-faith-in-yourself/) and then rely on your own thoughts henceforth to get the maximum benefit. Collecting information does not increase your knowledge.
* [Use outlines](/posts/how-i-use-outlines-to-write-any-text/) to start with the first draft of your writing project.
* Then [ease into writing](/posts/ease-into-writing/) by adding Zettel notes to the outline, pasting their contents in. 

Please tell us [in the comments](/posts/getting-started/#comments) what you always wanted to know, where you struggle, or what you think a beginner should know.
