Here used to be a review about the macOS app "[SlipBox](http://tabi-software.com/slipbox/)". Sascha and Christian don't evaluate apps that compete with _The Archive_ anymore for obvious reasons, so this review had to go the way of the dodo, too. See our [review policy](/posts/our-software-review-policy/) for details.
