Recently, I found some Evernote related posts which seem to be the Universe's hint that I should please finally install Evernote and try to make a Zettelkasten from it.

I will, pinky promise. Just not in 2014 anymore.

* Sutanto aka Sayz Lim uses Evernote to [store book highlights][1] from Kindle and iBooks app. Evernote seems to be well-suited as a cross-platform + web bucket to store quotes.
* Thomas Honeyman wrote about how to organize your knowledge in Evernote [using tags and categories][2] in a certain way. Since neither I nor Sascha have used Evernote seriously yet, I wouldn't know how different Thomas' apporach is from the common sense.
* On a side note, Brett Kelly's [Evernote Essentials][ee] seems to be on sale.[^aff] Maybe I should pick it up now to save some money when I look into using Evernote.

Evernote seems to have changed a lot in recent years. I'm eager to look into it, especially as I doubt its ecosystem will be a good fit due to Evernote being a data silo. We'll see!
