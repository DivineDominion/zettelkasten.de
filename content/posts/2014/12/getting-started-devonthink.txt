Just now, a few days after publishing Marko's article on [DEVONthink as a Zettelkasten archive](/posts/2014/12/devonthink-zettelkasten-review/), did I stumble upon Christopher Mayo's [excellent collection of DEVONthink resources.][dt]

Apart from his own introductory words on using DEVONthink, Christopher provides a *huge* collection of links to get you started. And he showcases 22 different use cases so you may learn from pro users how to facilitate DEVONthink's potential. I checked out a few of them and I think they alone are worth visiting Christopher's post if you want to find out more about DEVONthink.
