description: "How to transform insights from “How to Read a Book” by Adler/van Doren into actionable strategies to improve your reading."

Dear Zettlers,

Currently, I am slowly processing "How to Read a Book" by Adler and
van Doren.

It is a classic book on reading, which I read more than a decade ago.
Contrary to the contemporary praise, I didn't like it. The reason is
that you can learn a lot *about* reading, but I didn't find anything
actionable. It reminded me of the SQ3R reading method which we learned
in university, only to find out that in practice nobody uses it.

I think there are two undervalued aspects of developing reading skills:

1. **Problem-solving skills, in particular decision-making skills.** By
   far, the best paper I read on this issue is "Detailed
   Characterization of the Expert Problem-Solving Process in Science
   and Engineering: Guidance for Teaching and Assessment"[^argenta]
   Each book should be treated as a problem to be solved: How to
   attack it? How much time to invest in it, and how to spread this
   time over the chapters (evenly or weighted)? How can I re-construct
   it, so I learn the most? Is this a book that should be treated as
   inspiration, or should I really make an effort to re-create the
   content in my own words?
2. **Pattern recognition.** There are general patterns like arguments,
   walls of empirical evidence ("XY et al. performed a study and the
   results were like this. Z et al. performed a study and the results
   were like this"), anecdotes as evidence surrogates (epistemic
   blunder) vs anecdotes as illustrations (legit didactic tool) etc.
   There are also specific patterns (e.g., typical patterns of studies
   on dietary interventions).

This is the reason I am re-reading the book: Since my goal is to
deepen my reading skills further and improve my coaching, I will
process this book with the goal to create thinking tools that help
with the above skills. Most likely, this book will be exploitable for
the first type of skills.

Your takeaways:

1. **Be highly intentional when you read.** Intention creates
   intensity. If a book truly grips you, intensity can be treated as a
   given. However, in most of the cases, you will lack the intensity
   necessary to get the most out of your reading. In numbers:
   Sometimes, I catch myself reading papers with no deliberately
   created intensity. Then, it takes me 4–6 times (!) longer to work
   through the paper, while getting less out of it, compared to a mode
   with proper intensity.
2. **Focus on developing two sets of skills.** Meta-skills (1st
   category) and higher-level reading skills (2nd category). How do
   you do this? This is what I am trying to work out. I am a stage in
   which I can explain my individual decisions and can walk other
   people through their individual decisions as a (Socratic) guide.
   However, this is not enough. The next step will be to develop an
   inventory of exercises, which then will develop into a system that
   makes actionable what Adler and van Doren provide on a more
   theoretical level. But then, I will add patterns and pattern
   recognition exercises of the 2nd.

**What if you want to take action right now?** 

1. Read the book *How to Read a Book* and keep in mind that it tells
   you a lot *about* reading. Your task is then to transform this book
   into action items (templates, checklists, workflows) and then put
   aside training time (e.g., create strategy plans on how to read and
   process for 20 books). One important step in the whole value
   creation chain of reading this book is to put it into practice.
   Practice is the habit of deliberately improving a skill.
2. Subscribe to the newsletter. Oh, the fact that are reading this
   right now means that you are already subscribed. Then you will be
   updated when and how I will publish the material on reading.

Live long and prosper,<br>Sascha
