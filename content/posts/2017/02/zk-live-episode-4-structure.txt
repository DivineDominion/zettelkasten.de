In [today's episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKNyirFHVAU) we used our crappy English (I don't know what went wrong today) to talk about misconceptions when using the Zettelkasten: you cannot automate yourself away. The archive always needs an intelligent (!) user to help generate ideas, and you need to take note of them for later retrieval.

Also, Mr. Andersen was with us again and this asked about a proper reading workflow. (Answers about 55mins into the video.) Our response was pragmatic:

* If you think the text is something you want to refer to as a unit later, create a structure Zettel note that resembles the text's outline or table of contents.
* If you only need parts of the text, take what you need and add proper citation. Don't worry about being thorough for the sake of being thorough.
* All in all, strict rules like "you always have to create a book note that resembles the book's structure" don't take you far. Go with the flow and experiment. Different things works best at different times.
