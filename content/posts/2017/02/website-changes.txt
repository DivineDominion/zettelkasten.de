I've updated this website a bit. Apart from minor visual tweaks (icons!), the highlights include:

* The navigation now includes other cornerstone pages!
* There is a new [Zettelkasten Live overview](/live/) with the calendar and important links to watch us talk.
* I finally added a [list of guest posts](/authors/guests/) to highlight the amazing community contributions! The [blog archive](/posts/) now also highlights them. This was long overdue, sorry!

Oh, and Sascha and I scheduled the [next Zettelkasten Live episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhdG0xO620k) to upcoming Thursday, Feb. 16th, 4:00 p.m. UTC+1! We collected a ton of questions and I don't know where we'll start, yet. Thanks for sending your questions to us!
