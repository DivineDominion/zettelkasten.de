In [this week's episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQw5ySLxDR8), Sascha pulled out the digital pen and visualizes the notes from the archive that grew over the past couple of episodes. You'll see how local structures turn into entry points of new topics and how note sequences ("Folgezettel") can be created from a messy start.

We discussed weak ties (tags) and strong ties (links) and note sequences ("Folgezettel") in a post about [Different Kinds of Ties](/posts/kinds-of-ties/) in more detail, so if you feel you need to catch up with the jargon first, read that post and make sure to have a look at the awesome comments.

Also, if you agree that I am much prettier with facial hair, don't hesitate to offer suggestions in the comments. Every input is welcome, as always.
