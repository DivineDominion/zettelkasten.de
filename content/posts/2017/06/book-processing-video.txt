Today, [Sascha talks about his workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DIEiIH-N24&index=1&list=PLHwtkAtdkx1KeyPHN5CdfVJcZi1uNZ6tC) of processing books. The demonstration is supposed to highlight the power of a useful search -- in opposition to overly fancy software features. At about minute 22:00, Sascha also demonstrates using _The Archive_ for this in all its buggy glory.
