In [this week's episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W3fqizIGZU) we talked about the dangers of automatization. In short, the computer may help you find stuff, but if you rely on its power 100%, you will end up with a homogenous mush of notes. That's when we also mentioned Nassim Taleb's notion of the "barbell method" to antifragilize your life .

Thanks to our long term question asker Mr. Andersen, Sascha demoed branching of notes from two directions: top-down and bottom-up. You can find that in the last 15 minutes or so. (More precise annotations are always welcome in the comments!)
