Sascha is preparing a video series showcasing the unique features of our app _The Archive_. Here's the intro:

Remember that we follow a "software-agnostic approach". That means our app will be great, but it will still be replaceable. Because we don't want to lock people in with things they couldn't do by any other means. The workflow and the method are important, not the tools!

Meanwhile, Sascha is writing the new book and I am working on the app. We are [dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) the beta of _The Archive_ to ourselves already. You cannot imagine how many problems stay under the radar until you try to use the product every day. 

Ah well, time to get back to work.
