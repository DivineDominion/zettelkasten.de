In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWHhdXi8X4U&index=1&list=PLHwtkAtdkx1KeyPHN5CdfVJcZi1uNZ6tC), Sascha talks about the "nv-Core" -- that's our secret name for the kind of interaction facilitated by famous [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net), and made even more accessible thanks to the [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) variant we are raving about for years on this blog.

In short, it's all about speed, and "NV" nailed the "velocity" part.
