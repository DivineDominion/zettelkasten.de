I fixed a few broken links on this site, both outgoing and between blog posts. To that end I re-read a few of the older pieces on this site.

Check out these goldies:

* [Create a Zettelkasten for your Notes to Improve Thinking and Writing](/posts/zettelkasten-improves-thinking-writing/)
* [The Collector's Fallacy](/posts/collectors-fallacy/)
* [Building Blocks of a Zettelkasten](/posts/zettelkasten-building-blocks/)
* [The 2 Forms of a Zettel Note](/posts/zettel-nature-two-forms/)

Sascha's next post is in our extensive review loop already, by the way, so stay tuned.
