Sorry, folks, but this week's episode recording didn't take place. On Wednesday night I was struck hard by spontaneous and annoying bowel-emptying and I still couldn't think straight when the scheduled recording would have taken place. I'm feeling a lot better already and we'll try again next Thursday, Dec. 15th, same time: 16:00&nbsp;UTC+01.

As always, just shoot your questions and demo requests at us!
