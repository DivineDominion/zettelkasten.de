Do you need help or just want to take the next step in note-taking, creating thinking tools and creative knowledge work in general? I am there for you and happy to equip you with powerful tools for your journey.

## Your Benefits

1. **Create value with each action you take.** A common misconception about note-taking is that it's only an intermediary step to create value. The truth is that note-taking can be the very act of value-creation itself!
2. **Improve your thinking by learning how to develop a thought fully.** The fully developed thought might be the single most important part of the puzzle. A note should be fully developed, not just scribbles. Then and only then is it fertile soil to grow your thinking and problem-solving.
3. **Create a thinking machine that multiplies the power of your mind.** This is where the Zettelkasten Method shines. It is the most powerful note-taking architecture.
4. **Upgrade your mind to a new level.** Practicing the Zettelkasten Method is fitness training for your mind. Over time, you will blow yourself away by your next-level abilities.
5. **Increase your productivity by setting up a powerful workflow.** Each step of your workflow will result in knowledge-based value creation if you set it up correctly.

## How I Will Help You

Not everyone needs everything. You can choose the most valuable aspect of the coaching for you.

1. I will teach you the foundational knowledge of the Zettelkasten Method. This includes what a note should look like and how to setup the basic architecture of your note-taking system.
2. I will teach you how to develop a thought fully and create a note that is valuable for eternity.
3. I will teach you how to create personal digital gardens that bear fruits.
4. I will provide you with specialised knowledge tools if you have special needs.

The first coaching session will take 60--90 minutes. In one session, I can teach the fundamentals of the Zettelkasten Method. The software you want to use doesn't matter when I teach the Zettelkasten Method.

But I highly recommend at least a second session: from my experience, people underestimate what can be achieved if you learn how to develop a thought (and therefore, a note) fully, yet lack the skills to do so.

We can truly improve your knowledge mastery if we conduct multiple sessions. Then we can hit an intensive training and mentoring. To encourage you to make this decision I will give you a big discount on if commit to multiple session at once:

## A Bit About Me

<img src="/coaching/about-sascha.jpg" class="coaching__about-me">

I am Sascha, and I have been a coach for a decade now. My mission is to teach people how to overcome challenges and transform themselves to match any challenges. One of the challenges is knowledge work. I used the Zettelkasten Method to teach knowledge work to high performing clients who wanted to take the next step in excellence as well as clients struggling with depression who just wanted to finish their master's thesis.
